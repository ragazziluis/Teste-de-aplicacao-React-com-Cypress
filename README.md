# üôã‚Äç Teste de Aplica√ß√£o React com Cypress - 1 [Luis Miranda]

## :mag: Introdu√ß√£o

I think he knows his footprints
On the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows his hands around
A cold glass
Make me wanna know that body
Like it's mine

## :dart: Objetivo

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm seventeen, nobody understands
No one understands
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, oh! I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude
Like, I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him
I think he knows
I think he knows

I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me, and boy I understand
Boy I understand

Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
